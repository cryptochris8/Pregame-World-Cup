## To Deploy Updated Site:

Since your site is already live on Netlify, just:

1. **If using drag & drop:**
   - Delete old deployment
   - Drag new `website` folder to Netlify

2. **If using Git:**
   ```bash
   cd D:\Pregame-World-Cup\website
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Pregame logo throughout site"
   git push
   ```
   - Netlify will auto-deploy in ~30 seconds

## Logo Optimization (Optional)

The current logo is 612KB, which is fine but can be optimized:

**To optimize (if needed):**
1. Use an online tool like TinyPNG.com
2. Or convert to WebP format
3. Could reduce to ~50-100KB

Current size is acceptable for modern web, but optimization would make it even faster!

## Preview Changes Locally:

Simply open `index.html` in your browser, or if using a local server:
```bash
cd website
python -m http.server 8080
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```
