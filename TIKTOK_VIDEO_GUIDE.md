## HIGGSFIELD COMPLETE GUIDE

### How Higgsfield Works

Higgsfield is an **image-to-video** tool. You need a reference image first, then it animates it with cinematic camera movements.

2. Select a camera movement preset (50+ options)
3. Write a detailed prompt describing the action
4. Click "Enhance" to auto-improve your prompt (recommended)
5. Set duration (3 or 5 seconds)
6. Generate and download

### Video Specs
- **Duration:** 3 or 5 seconds per clip
- **Resolution:** 720p
- **Frame Rate:** 30 fps

### Prompt Writing Formula

**Structure your Higgsfield prompts like this:**

```
[SUBJECT ACTION] + [CAMERA RELATIONSHIP] + [ENVIRONMENT DETAILS] + [LIGHTING/MOOD] + [SENSORY DETAILS]
```

**Example:**
```
A striker in a red national team jersey sprints toward goal with the ball at his feet, the camera tracking alongside at ground level, the massive stadium crowd rising to their feet in anticipation, golden sunset light casting long shadows across the pristine pitch, grass particles kicking up with each powerful stride
```

### Higgsfield Prompt Tips

1. **Use active verbs** - "sprints", "erupts", "soars" not "is running"
2. **Describe camera relationship** - "camera positioned low", "tracking alongside"
3. **Include sensory details** - sounds, textures, atmosphere
4. **Specify lighting** - "golden hour", "stadium floodlights", "dramatic shadows"
5. **Click "Enhance"** - Let AI improve your prompt automatically
6. **Match image to movement** - Centered subjects for orbits, wide shots for FPV
