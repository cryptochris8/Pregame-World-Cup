  "bio": "Legendary Norwegian coach who ended the nation's 27-year World Cup drought by qualifying Norway for the 2026 tournament, winning all eight group matches with a stunning 37 goals scored and just five conceded. A former international player whose career was cut short by a heart attack in 2001, Solbakken became one of Scandinavia's most decorated club managers with eight Danish Superliga titles at FC Copenhagen. His all-action attacking approach, built around Erling Haaland's prolific goalscoring, has made Norway one of Europe's most exciting teams."
