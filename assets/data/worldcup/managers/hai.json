  "bio": "French coach who made history by leading Haiti to their second-ever World Cup qualification in 2025, remarkably without ever setting foot in the country due to security concerns. Previously guided Kenya to the 2019 AFCON after a 15-year absence, earning a CAF Men's National Team of the Year nomination. Known for imposing tactical structure and fostering team cohesion through counter-attacking football, relying on fast transitions and wing play."
