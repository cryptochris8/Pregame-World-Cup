  "historicalAnalysis": "Brazil vs Argentina is football's greatest rivalry, transcending sport to become a cultural phenomenon. These South American giants have met over 100 times, with Brazil holding a slight edge historically. Their World Cup encounters, however, have been remarkably rare—just five meetings on the biggest stage.\n\nThe most recent chapter favored Argentina: Messi's team defeated Brazil in the 2021 Copa América final on Brazilian soil, then won the 2022 World Cup while Brazil crashed out in the quarter-finals. This has shifted the rivalry's narrative for the first time in years.\n\nFor 2026, Argentina enter as defending champions with Messi potentially in his final World Cup. Brazil, without a title since 2002, are desperate to reassert their status as football's greatest nation.",
