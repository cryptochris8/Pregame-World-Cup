  "historicalAnalysis": "England and Ghana have met only once: a 2011 friendly at Wembley that ended 1-1. Andy Carroll opened the scoring for England, but Asamoah Gyan's stoppage-time equalizer earned Ghana a draw. That single meeting makes this 2026 World Cup encounter virtually a blank slate.\n\nHowever, England fans will forever associate Ghana with 2010. In that World Cup quarter-final, Luis Suárez's deliberate handball on the line denied Ghana a place in the semi-finals. Gyan's subsequent penalty miss meant Ghana—and by extension, Africa—were denied a historic first semi-final appearance. England, meanwhile, suffered their own 2010 trauma: a 4-1 demolition by Germany in the round of 16, compounded by Frank Lampard's wrongly disallowed goal.\n\nGhana have produced some of English football's finest imports: Michael Essien, Sulley Muntari, and more recently Thomas Partey. The connection between these nations runs deep through the Premier League.",

  "tacticalPreview": "England's 4-3-3 system is built around Bellingham's dynamism and the attacking trio of Foden, Kane, and Saka. Their pressing and quick transitions are dangerous against any opponent.\n\nGhana typically employ a 4-2-3-1 with Partey shielding the defense and Kudus creating from advanced positions. Their key is to stay organized and hit England on the break. Set-pieces will be crucial given Ghana's aerial threat.",
