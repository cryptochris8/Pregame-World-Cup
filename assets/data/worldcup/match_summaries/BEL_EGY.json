  "historicalAnalysis": "Belgium and Egypt have never met at a World Cup, making this 2026 encounter historic. Their three previous meetings have been friendlies, with Egypt surprisingly holding a 2-1 advantage including a notable 2-0 victory in Brussels in 2018 where Mohamed Salah was in brilliant form.\n\nBelgium's \"golden generation\"—De Bruyne, Lukaku, Courtois—is aging, and the 2026 World Cup may represent their final opportunity to deliver on years of promise. Ranked first in the world for an extended period and third-place finishers at the 2018 World Cup, Belgium have consistently underperformed relative to expectations in knockout rounds.\n\nEgypt, meanwhile, are Africa's most decorated nation (seven AFCON titles) but have struggled to make an impact at World Cups. Their 2018 appearance was their first in 28 years, and it ended in group stage elimination despite having Salah. The 2026 edition offers another chance.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Belgium's 3-4-2-1 system maximizes De Bruyne's creativity and provides attacking width, but questions remain about their aging defensive line. Egypt typically play a pragmatic 4-2-3-1 centered around getting the ball to Salah in dangerous positions.\n\nThe key matchup is De Bruyne vs Egypt's midfield. If Belgium control the middle, their quality will tell. Egypt need to stay compact, frustrate Belgium, and hope Salah produces moments of magic. Set-pieces could be decisive.",

    "reasoning": "Belgium's overall squad quality remains superior despite aging. However, their 2022 World Cup disaster (group stage exit) raises questions about mentality. Egypt's 2-0 win in 2018 shows they can beat Belgium.",
