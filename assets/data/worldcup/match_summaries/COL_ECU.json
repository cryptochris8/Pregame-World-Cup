  "historicalAnalysis": "Colombia and Ecuador share a border and a passionate football rivalry. The Andean neighbors have met over 30 times, with Colombia holding a significant advantage. World Cup meetings have been rare, but qualifiers and Copa América clashes are always intense affairs.\n\nColombia's 2014 World Cup quarter-final run, led by James Rodríguez's Golden Boot performance, remains their finest hour. Ecuador have qualified for four World Cups but struggle to advance past the group stage.\n\nBoth nations feature rising talents: Colombia's Luis Díaz has become world-class at Liverpool, while Ecuador's Moisés Caicedo is one of the Premier League's best midfielders.",
