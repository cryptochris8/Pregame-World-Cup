The Netherlands are three-time runners-up seeking their first title, while Tunisia have consistently qualified but never progressed beyond the group stage.\n\nThe Netherlands' 2022 World Cup ended in quarter-final disappointment against Argentina. Their squad features a blend of experienced players and emerging talents, with Van Dijk anchoring the defense.\n\nTunisia's 2022 campaign included a famous win over France. Their organization and spirit make them dangerous opponents for any team.",
