  "historicalAnalysis": "Iran and New Zealand meet for the first time in World Cup history, though they faced each other in a 2017 friendly that Iran won 2-0. Both nations are regulars in the intercontinental playoffs, often fighting for the same World Cup spot.\n\nIran have been Asia's most consistent World Cup qualifiers, appearing in 6 of the last 7 tournaments. Their 2022 World Cup saw an emotional campaign amid political turmoil at home, including a famous 2-0 win over Wales.\n\nNew Zealand qualified through the Oceania region and a playoff victory. The All Whites have only progressed past the group stage once (three draws in 2010), but this experienced squad has European-based players who can compete at this level.",
