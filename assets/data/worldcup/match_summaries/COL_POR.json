  "historicalAnalysis": "In one of football's most surprising historical footnotes, Colombia and Portugal have never played each other. Despite both nations boasting rich football traditions and producing generations of world-class talent, fate has never brought them together on the pitch.\n\nThis 2026 World Cup encounter will be their first-ever meeting, making it one of the most anticipated debuts of the tournament. Colombia's history features the creative genius of Carlos Valderrama and James Rodríguez, while Portugal can claim Eusébio and Cristiano Ronaldo as their greatest icons.\n\nColombia's 2014 World Cup quarter-final run, led by James Rodríguez (who won the Golden Boot), represents their finest hour. Portugal, meanwhile, won Euro 2016 and the Nations League in 2019, adding to Cristiano Ronaldo's legacy even as his national team career winds down.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Portugal's 4-3-3 system balances Ronaldo's predatory instincts with the creative genius of Bruno Fernandes and the pace of Leão. Their midfield depth and defensive quality make them one of the tournament favorites.\n\nColombia's 4-2-3-1 relies on Luis Díaz's explosiveness and James Rodríguez's vision. Their South American flair combined with pressing intensity can trouble any opponent. The key is defensive discipline against Portugal's quality.",
