  "historicalAnalysis": "Belgium and Iran met at the 2018 World Cup, with Belgium winning 1-0 through a late Lukaku goal. That match was tighter than expected, with Iran's organization frustrating Belgium for long periods.\n\nBelgium's golden generation is evolving—De Bruyne and Lukaku remain, but younger talents like Doku and Openda are now key players. Their 2022 World Cup was disappointing, crashing out in the group stage.\n\nIran continue to be Asia's most consistent World Cup qualifiers. Their 2022 campaign included an emotional 2-0 win over Wales, proving their ability to deliver on the big stage.",
