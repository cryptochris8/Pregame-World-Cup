  "historicalAnalysis": "Brazil and Morocco's rivalry has been transformed by Morocco's stunning 2022 World Cup run to the semi-finals, the first African nation to achieve this feat. Their three meetings tell a story of evolving African football. In 1998, Brazil dominated 3-0 in the group stage, with Rivaldo and Ronaldo showcasing the Seleção's attacking brilliance. The encounter seemed routine—a powerhouse dispatching an African underdog.\n\nFast forward to March 2023, and the landscape had shifted dramatically. Just months after Morocco had knocked out Spain and Portugal en route to the semi-finals, they hosted Brazil in Tangier and won 2-1. It was a statement victory that confirmed Morocco's 2022 success was no fluke. The Atlas Lions had arrived as a genuine force in world football.\n\nThis World Cup 2026 encounter carries enormous weight. Brazil, five-time world champions but without a title since 2002, face a Morocco side brimming with confidence and quality. The dynamics have fundamentally changed since their last World Cup meeting.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Brazil under their current setup favor an attacking 4-2-3-1 built around Vinícius Jr.'s dribbling and Rodrygo's movement. Morocco's 4-3-3 under Walid Regragui is defensively organized but devastatingly quick in transition, as Spain and Portugal discovered in 2022.\n\nMorocco's key is to frustrate Brazil and hit them on the break. Their defensive organization in 2022 was exceptional, conceding just one goal before the semi-final. Brazil must be patient, moving the ball quickly to create gaps. The match could be decided by a moment of individual brilliance from either side.",

    "predictedScore": "2-1",
    "confidence": 55,
    "reasoning": "Brazil's attacking quality gives them a narrow edge, but Morocco's 2022 pedigree and 2023 victory make this extremely tight. Brazil's experience and squad depth could prove decisive, but expect Morocco to make them work for it.",
    "alternativeScenario": "Morocco's organized defense and counter-attacking threat could produce a stunning 1-0 or 2-1 upset. A repeat of their 2023 friendly victory is entirely feasible."
