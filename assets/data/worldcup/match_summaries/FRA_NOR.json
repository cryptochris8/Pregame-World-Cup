  "historicalAnalysis": "Norway and France have met at the World Cup before—Norway famously beat France 2-1 at the 1998 World Cup in Marseille, one of the biggest upsets of that tournament. France went on to win that World Cup, but the Norwegian victory remains iconic.\n\nFrance are the 2022 runners-up and 2018 champions, with Mbappé leading one of the world's most talented squads. Les Bleus remain among the favorites despite their final loss to Argentina.\n\nNorway return to the World Cup for the first time since 1998, with Haaland's goal-scoring prowess their main weapon. This is a dream matchup for Norwegian fans.",
