  "historicalAnalysis": "Qatar and Switzerland have never met in competitive action. This matchup pits the 2022 World Cup hosts against one of Europe's most consistent performers. Qatar's home World Cup saw them eliminated in the group stage without a win—a disappointment they're eager to avenge.\n\nSwitzerland have established themselves as perennial Round of 16 contenders, with memorable victories over France (Euro 2020) and Spain (2010 World Cup). Their blend of experienced veterans and emerging talents makes them dangerous opponents.\n\nQatar have rebuilt significantly since 2022, investing heavily in their domestic league and youth development. This is their chance to prove that hosting the World Cup wasn't their peak.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Switzerland's 3-4-2-1 provides defensive solidity while Xhaka orchestrates from deep. Their ability to absorb pressure and strike on the counter is world-class.\n\nQatar's 5-3-2 emphasizes compact defending and quick transitions through Afif. Their technical quality is underrated, but consistency against top European sides remains a question.",
