  "historicalAnalysis": "This is a historic first meeting between Curaçao and Ivory Coast. Curaçao, making their World Cup debut with a population of just 150,000, face the reigning AFCON champions in what could be a David vs Goliath encounter.\n\nIvory Coast won the 2024 AFCON on home soil in dramatic fashion, coming from behind in the tournament before winning it all. Their blend of experienced stars and young talents makes them formidable.\n\nFor Curaçao, every match at this World Cup is historic. Their qualification from CONCACAF is one of football's great underdog stories.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Ivory Coast's 4-3-3 is built on power and pace. Haller's hold-up play and finishing are key, with width from the flanks creating chances.\n\nCuraçao's 5-4-1 is purely about survival. They'll park the bus and hope to create a moment of magic on the counter or from a set-piece.",
