  "historicalAnalysis": "Ecuador and Germany have never met at a World Cup. Germany are four-time champions seeking redemption after consecutive group stage exits. Ecuador have proven they can compete at the World Cup level, with strong showings in 2022.\n\nGermany's 2022 exit was their second consecutive group stage failure—unprecedented for German football. The rebuild under new leadership has produced exciting young talents like Wirtz and Musiala.\n\nEcuador's 2022 World Cup saw wins over Qatar and competitive performances against Netherlands and Senegal. Their young squad, led by Caicedo, has only improved.",
