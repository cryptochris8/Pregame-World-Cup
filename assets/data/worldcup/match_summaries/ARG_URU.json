  "historicalAnalysis": "Argentina and Uruguay share football's oldest international rivalry, dating back to 1901. These Rio de la Plata neighbors have met over 200 times, with Argentina holding a slight advantage. Their World Cup history includes the very first final in 1930, won by Uruguay in Montevideo.\n\nBoth nations are steeped in World Cup glory: Argentina with three titles (1978, 1986, 2022) and Uruguay with two (1930, 1950). This match pits Argentina's defending champions against Uruguay's proud tradition.\n\nUnder Messi, Argentina have rediscovered their winning mentality. Uruguay under Bielsa play with intense pressing and never-say-die attitude.",
