  "historicalAnalysis": "Croatia and Ghana have met only once: a goalless friendly draw in 2008 ahead of Euro 2008. That single encounter provides virtually no reference point for this 2026 World Cup match, making it one of the tournament's most intriguing matchups between accomplished football nations.\n\nCroatia's World Cup pedigree is exceptional for a nation of 4 million people. Third place in 1998, runners-up in 2018, and third again in 2022, they consistently overperform expectations. Their midfield trio of Modrić, Kovačić, and Brozović has defined an era.\n\nGhana's 2010 quarter-final run, cruelly ended by Suárez's handball, remains their finest World Cup hour. They've struggled since, with early exits in 2014 and 2022. The 2026 tournament represents a chance to restore African pride and prove that 2010 wasn't a fluke.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Croatia's 4-3-3 is built around midfield dominance. If Modrić, Kovačić, and Brozović control possession, Ghana will struggle to get the ball. Croatia's patience and experience in tournament football is unmatched.\n\nGhana's energetic 4-2-3-1 relies on pressing and athleticism. Kudus's dribbling and Partey's tackles could disrupt Croatia's rhythm. Ghana need to stay aggressive for 90 minutes; any let-up and Croatia will punish them.",
