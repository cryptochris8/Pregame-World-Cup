  "historicalAnalysis": "Croatia and Panama have never met in any competitive or friendly match, making this 2026 World Cup encounter their first-ever meeting. It's a striking illustration of how the World Cup brings together nations from opposite ends of football's global landscape.\n\nCroatia, with their remarkable World Cup pedigree (third in 1998, runners-up in 2018, third in 2022), are one of the tournament's established powers despite their small population of 4 million. Their sustained excellence has made them one of international football's most respected nations.\n\nPanama, by contrast, made their World Cup debut only in 2018, losing all three group games including a 6-1 thrashing by England. Their qualification for 2026 represents just their second World Cup appearance. The contrast in experience could not be more stark.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Croatia's 4-3-3 built around midfield dominance should control this match. Their experience in World Cup encounters means they know how to manage games against less experienced opponents.\n\nPanama will likely sit deep in a 5-4-1 or 5-3-2, hoping to frustrate Croatia and hit them on the counter. Their best chance is set-pieces and maintaining defensive shape for as long as possible. Any early goal from Croatia could open floodgates.",

    "predictedScore": "3-0",
    "confidence": 88,
    "reasoning": "Croatia's quality advantage is substantial. Panama's 2018 World Cup (0 points, -11 goal difference) showed they struggle against elite opponents. This should be relatively comfortable for Croatia.",
    "alternativeScenario": "If Panama score first and frustrate Croatia, nerves could set in. A shock 1-0 Panama victory, while unlikely, would be one of the great World Cup upsets."
