  "historicalAnalysis": "Canada and Qatar meet for the first time in World Cup history. Canada are co-hosting this tournament, returning to the World Cup for only the second time in their history (after 1986). Qatar are the 2022 hosts looking for redemption after a disappointing home campaign.\n\nCanada's 2022 World Cup was brief but showed their potential—they scored against Belgium and Croatia but failed to earn a point. With home advantage and an improved squad, expectations are higher now.\n\nQatar's 2022 campaign saw them become the worst-performing host nation ever, losing all three group games. Their Asian Cup win in 2023 showed they can still compete at the continental level.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Canada's 4-3-3 unleashes Davies as an attacking wing-back, with David leading the line. Their pace in transition is frightening, and home support will drive aggressive pressing.\n\nQatar's 5-3-2 will be more conservative after 2022's lessons. They'll look to be compact and hit on counters through Afif's creativity.",
