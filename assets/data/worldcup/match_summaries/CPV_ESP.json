  "historicalAnalysis": "This is a historic first meeting as Cape Verde make their World Cup debut. The tiny island nation of just 500,000 people has produced remarkable footballers, many playing in Portugal's top divisions, but this is their crowning achievement.\n\nSpain, the 2024 European Champions, enter as one of the favorites. Their young, dynamic squad destroyed England 2-1 in the Euro final with a performance that announced a new golden generation. Lamine Yamal, Nico Williams, and Pedri represent the future of Spanish football.\n\nFor Cape Verde, simply being here is a triumph. But their Portuguese-influenced technical football means they won't roll over—they'll compete with pride and try to create historic moments.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Spain's 4-3-3 emphasizes possession and quick combinations. With Yamal and Williams on the wings, they have devastating pace to complement their technical mastery.\n\nCape Verde's 4-4-2 will be compact and organized. They'll look to frustrate Spain and hit on the counter, with set-pieces potentially their best route to goal.",
