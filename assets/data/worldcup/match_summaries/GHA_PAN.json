  "historicalAnalysis": "Ghana and Panama meet for the first time in World Cup history. Ghana are four-time AFCON champions with a proud World Cup tradition—their 2010 quarter-final run remains one of Africa's greatest World Cup achievements.\n\nPanama made their World Cup debut in 2018, where the experience of simply being there seemed to overwhelm them. Now, with a more experienced squad, they return with greater ambitions.\n\nThis is a crucial match for both teams' knockout round hopes in a tough group with England and Croatia.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Ghana's 4-2-3-1 unleashes Kudus in the No. 10 role, with Partey providing defensive security. Their combination of power and technique is formidable.\n\nPanama's 4-4-2 is compact and disciplined. They'll look to frustrate Ghana and hit on counter-attacks, with aerial threats from set-pieces a key weapon.",
