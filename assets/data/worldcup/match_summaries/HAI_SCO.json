  "historicalAnalysis": "This is a historic first meeting between Haiti and Scotland. Haiti are making their first World Cup appearance since 1974, when they became the first Caribbean nation to qualify. Scotland return to the World Cup looking to make an impact after years of near-misses.\n\nHaiti's qualification is one of the great stories of this World Cup cycle, emerging from a competitive CONCACAF region despite limited resources. Their passionate fanbase and attacking flair have captured neutral hearts worldwide.\n\nScotland's journey has been marked by heartbreak—agonizing playoff defeats and last-day qualification failures. This 2026 squad, featuring Premier League quality throughout, represents perhaps their strongest generation in decades.",
