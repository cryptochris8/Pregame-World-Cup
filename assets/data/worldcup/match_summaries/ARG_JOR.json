  "historicalAnalysis": "This is a first ever meeting between Jordan and Argentina. Jordan make their World Cup debut, while Argentina are the reigning champions with Messi potentially playing his final World Cup matches.\n\nArgentina's 2022 triumph was the culmination of Messi's career, finally lifting the trophy that had eluded him. The squad's mentality and togetherness make them formidable.\n\nJordan's qualification is historic for the nation. Their 2023 Asian Cup final appearance showed they can compete at the highest level in Asia, but Argentina represents an entirely different challenge.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Argentina's 4-3-3 is built on collective excellence. Messi still provides magic, but the system doesn't depend solely on him anymore.\n\nJordan's 4-4-2 will be compact and disciplined. Their gameplan is survival—frustrate Argentina and hope for any counter-attacking moment.",
