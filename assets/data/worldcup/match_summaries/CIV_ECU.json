  "tacticalPreview": "Ivory Coast's 4-3-3 is built on power and pace, with Haller as the target man and wingers providing width. Their physicality in midfield could overwhelm Ecuador.\n\nEcuador's 4-4-2 emphasizes quick passing and movement. Caicedo's ability to break up play and drive forward will be crucial, with their forwards looking to capitalize on any defensive errors.",

    "confidence": 55,
    "reasoning": "Two evenly matched sides should produce a tight encounter. Both have the quality to score but also defensive organization to limit chances.",
    "alternativeScenario": "If Ivory Coast's physicality dominates, a 2-1 win is possible. If Ecuador control midfield through Caicedo, they could edge it."
