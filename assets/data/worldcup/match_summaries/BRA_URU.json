  "historicalAnalysis": "The Brazil-Uruguay rivalry is marked by one of football's most famous moments: the 1950 World Cup final, known as the \"Maracanazo.\" In front of nearly 200,000 fans at the Maracanã, Uruguay shocked Brazil 2-1 to win the World Cup, causing national mourning in Brazil.\n\nThat trauma has defined this rivalry ever since. Brazil have dominated recent decades, but Uruguay's warrior mentality means they always compete fiercely. Uruguay's 2010 World Cup fourth-place finish and 2011 Copa América victory showed they remain formidable.\n\nUruguay enter 2026 under Marcelo Bielsa, bringing his trademark intense pressing style. Brazil's young generation of Vinícius Jr., Rodrygo, and Endrick represents a new era.",
