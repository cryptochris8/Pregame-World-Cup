  "historicalAnalysis": "New Zealand and Egypt meet for the first time at a World Cup. Egypt return to the tournament after missing 2022, with Mohamed Salah leading a talented squad. New Zealand are the perennial Oceania champions making their third World Cup appearance.\n\nEgypt's absence from 2022 was painful after reaching the 2018 tournament and the 2022 AFCON final. With Salah at his peak, this is a crucial opportunity to showcase Egyptian football.\n\nNew Zealand remain unbeaten in World Cup history (3 draws in 2010), and their organization and spirit make them difficult opponents for anyone.",
