  "historicalAnalysis": "Germany and Ivory Coast have never met at a World Cup, making this 2026 encounter historic. Their two previous meetings were both draws: a 2-2 friendly in 2009 where Didier Drogba starred, and a 1-1 draw at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 that eliminated Germany from the tournament.\n\nGermany, four-time World Cup champions, enter 2026 seeking redemption after consecutive group-stage exits in 2018 and 2022. The 2022 disaster—eliminated despite beating Costa Rica 4-2 in their final match—was particularly painful for a nation that had dominated World Cups for decades.\n\nIvory Coast, meanwhile, are the reigning African champions after winning AFCON 2024 on home soil. That triumph, featuring a remarkable comeback from the brink of elimination, showcased the Elephants' resilience and quality. Their 2014 World Cup campaign ended in the group stage, and 2026 represents an opportunity to finally make the knockout rounds.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Germany's 4-2-3-1 under Julian Nagelsmann emphasizes quick passing and pressing. Wirtz and Musiala provide creativity, while the defense remains a concern after recent struggles.\n\nIvory Coast play a physical 4-3-3 that combines African athleticism with tactical organization. Their key is to match Germany's intensity early and use their pace in transition. Set-pieces could be crucial against Germany's occasionally vulnerable defense.",
