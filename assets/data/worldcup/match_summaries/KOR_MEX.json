  "historicalAnalysis": "Mexico and South Korea have met twice at World Cups, both matches won by Mexico. In 2018, Mexico won 2-1 in Rostov, while their 1998 meeting ended 3-1 to El Tri. However, South Korea's 2022 World Cup performance showed they can compete with anyone.\n\nBoth nations share a similar frustration—they consistently qualify but struggle to advance deep into tournaments. Mexico's Round of 16 curse is well-documented, while South Korea's 2002 semi-final run remains an outlier in their history.\n\nAs co-hosts, Mexico have extra pressure to perform. South Korea's dynamic attacking play and pressing intensity will provide a stern test.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Mexico's 4-3-3 will look to control possession and create through wide areas. Giménez's movement and finishing are key, with Lozano's pace stretching defenses.\n\nSouth Korea's 4-3-3 emphasizes pressing and quick transitions. Son's ability to drift and create, combined with Lee Kang-in's creativity, makes them dangerous in transition.",
