  "historicalAnalysis": "Brazil and Haiti have met just once—a 2016 Copa América Centenario match that Brazil won 7-1. That scoreline reflected the gulf in quality, but Haiti's mere presence at another major tournament shows their progress.\n\nBrazil enter seeking to end their World Cup drought—they haven't lifted the trophy since 2002, their longest wait since the tournament began. After 2022's painful quarter-final exit, the pressure is immense.\n\nHaiti's first World Cup in 52 years is about creating memories and inspiring the next generation. Playing Brazil, football's most decorated nation, is the ultimate test.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Brazil's 4-2-3-1 maximizes attacking firepower with Vinícius and Rodrygo terrorizing flanks. Their quick passing and movement should create numerous chances.\n\nHaiti's 5-4-1 will park the bus and hope to survive. Their gameplan is damage limitation while looking for any counter-attacking opportunity or set-piece moment.",
