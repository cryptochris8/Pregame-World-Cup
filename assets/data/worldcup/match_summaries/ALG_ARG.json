  "historicalAnalysis": "Argentina and Algeria's World Cup history spans three meetings across four decades. Their first encounter in 1982 saw Diego Maradona's Argentina defeat Algeria 2-0. More recently, at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Lionel Messi scored a 91st-minute winner to give Argentina a narrow 2-1 victory—a crucial goal that kept their campaign on track toward the final.\n\nArgentina enter 2026 as the reigning World Cup and Copa América champions, the undisputed best team in the world. Messi's 2022 triumph completed one of football's greatest stories, and Argentina are now looking to become the first nation since Brazil (1958, 1962) to win back-to-back World Cups.\n\nAlgeria, meanwhile, have never progressed past the World Cup group stage since their famous 1982 campaign. That tournament saw them defeat West Germany before being eliminated due to the infamous \"Disgrace of Gijón\" collusion between Germany and Austria. They've qualified for four World Cups but remain in search of knockout round glory.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Argentina's 4-3-3 under Lionel Scaloni balances possession with deadly counter-attacks. Even without Messi at his peak, their collective play and winning mentality make them formidable. Álvarez and Lautaro Martínez provide goal threat.\n\nAlgeria play an organized 4-3-3 built around Mahrez's creativity and Bennacer's midfield control. Their best chance is to stay compact and hit Argentina on the break. The challenge is containing Argentina's movement and pressing.",

    "reasoning": "Argentina's champion mentality and squad quality make them heavy favorites. Algeria have quality but lack the depth and experience to trouble the defending champions for 90 minutes.",
    "alternativeScenario": "A disciplined Algeria could frustrate Argentina and sneak a draw. If Mahrez produces magic and Argentina struggle to break down the defense, 1-1 is possible."
