  "historicalAnalysis": "Argentina and Austria have met 7 times, with Argentina winning 5. Their most notable World Cup encounter was the 1978 group stage in Argentina, where the hosts won 2-1 en route to their first World Cup title.\n\nArgentina enter as reigning World Cup and Copa América champions, with Messi seeking one final moment of glory. This is likely his last World Cup, and the team is determined to send him off in style.\n\nAustria have improved dramatically under Rangnick's gegenpressing system. Their Nations League performances have shown they can compete with Europe's best, and Alaba's leadership is invaluable.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Argentina's 4-3-3 under Scaloni is built on collective excellence. Messi still provides moments of magic, but Álvarez, Mac Allister, and Enzo Fernández offer goals and creativity.\n\nAustria's 4-2-3-1 emphasizes intense pressing and quick transitions. Their energy could disrupt Argentina's rhythm, with Sabitzer and Laimer providing box-to-box intensity.",
