  "historicalAnalysis": "The United States and Mexico share one of football's most intense rivalries, played out across more than 70 matches since 1934. This CONCACAF clash transcends sport, reflecting cultural, political, and historical tensions between neighboring nations. Mexico dominated the rivalry for decades, but the USA's growth since the 1990s has created genuine parity.\n\nThe 2002 World Cup Round of 16 meeting in South Korea remains the rivalry's defining World Cup moment. Brian McBride's header and Landon Donovan's strike gave the USA a famous 2-0 victory, eliminating Mexico and sending the Americans to the quarter-finals. That result fundamentally changed the power dynamic.\n\nFor the 2026 World Cup, both nations are co-hosts with enormous pressure to perform. This group stage clash in front of a divided home crowd will be one of the tournament's most anticipated matches.",
