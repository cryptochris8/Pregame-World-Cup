  "historicalAnalysis": "Chile and Cameroon have met rarely, with their most notable encounter coming at the 2017 Confederations Cup where Chile won 2-0. That match showcased Chile's golden generation at their peak.\n\nBoth nations have proud World Cup traditions: Chile's back-to-back Copa América victories (2015, 2016) and Cameroon's quarter-final appearances (1990). Both are now trying to recapture former glory with new generations.\n\nThis Group C clash could determine which team avoids bottom place.",
