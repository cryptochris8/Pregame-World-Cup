  "historicalAnalysis": "Tunisia and Japan have never met at a World Cup. Both nations have consistent World Cup pedigrees—Japan have qualified for every tournament since 1998, while Tunisia have appeared in 6 World Cups.\n\nJapan's 2022 World Cup saw remarkable victories over Germany and Spain in the group stage before losing to Croatia on penalties. Their blend of technical precision and European-based stars makes them formidable.\n\nTunisia's 2022 campaign featured a famous win over France, showing they can compete with anyone when their organization and intensity are right.",

  "tacticalPreview": "Japan's 4-2-3-1 emphasizes technical football and quick transitions. Kubo and Mitoma's dribbling can unlock any defense, while their pressing is relentless.\n\nTunisia's 4-3-3 is built on defensive organization first. They'll look to frustrate Japan and hit on counter-attacks, with Khazri providing the creative spark.",
