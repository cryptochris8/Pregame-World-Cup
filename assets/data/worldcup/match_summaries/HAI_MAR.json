  "historicalAnalysis": "This is a first ever meeting between Morocco and Haiti. Morocco are the 2022 World Cup semi-finalists, making history as the first African and Arab nation to reach that stage. Haiti return to the World Cup for the first time since 1974.\n\nMorocco's 2022 run captured hearts worldwide—victories over Belgium, Spain, and Portugal were remarkable. They enter 2026 with expectations of repeating or exceeding that performance.\n\nHaiti's qualification after 52 years is one of the great underdog stories. Their passionate fanbase and fearless approach make them entertaining opponents.",
