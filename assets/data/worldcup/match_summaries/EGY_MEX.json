  "historicalAnalysis": "Mexico and Egypt have met just twice, both friendlies without meaningful stakes. This World Cup encounter represents uncharted territory for both nations—a clash of CONCACAF and CAF powers with contrasting styles.\n\nMexico's World Cup pedigree is strong with 17 appearances and multiple deep runs. Egypt, despite dominating African football, have struggled on the world stage. Their 2018 World Cup campaign ended in group-stage elimination despite having Salah.\n\nThis match pits Mexico's possession-based approach against Egypt's counter-attacking style built around their superstar.",
