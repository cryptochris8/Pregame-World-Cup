  "historicalAnalysis": "Mexico and Canada's rivalry has intensified in recent years as Canada emerged as a genuine CONCACAF force. Historically, Mexico dominated completely—but the tables turned dramatically during 2022 World Cup qualifying when Canada defeated Mexico for the first time in over two decades.\n\nMexico's football pedigree is unmatched in CONCACAF: 17 World Cup appearances, quarter-final finishes in 1970 and 1986, and a tradition of producing technically gifted players. Canada, by contrast, are still building their legacy.\n\nAs co-hosts, both nations face immense pressure. Mexico's fans demand deep tournament runs, while Canada seek to prove their qualification wasn't a fluke. This match could determine who tops Group A.",
