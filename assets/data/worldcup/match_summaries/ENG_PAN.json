  "historicalAnalysis": "Panama and England met at the 2018 World Cup, with England winning 6-1 in one of the most one-sided matches of that tournament. Panama's debut World Cup saw them score their first ever goal (against England), a moment of national celebration despite the heavy defeat.\n\nEngland enter seeking to finally win a World Cup after 56 years of hurt. Under Thomas Tuchel, they've developed into genuine contenders with a squad featuring world-class talents like Bellingham and Kane.\n\nPanama return to the World Cup with more experience and higher ambitions, hoping to progress beyond the group stage for the first time.",
