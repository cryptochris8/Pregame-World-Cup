  "historicalAnalysis": "Uruguay and Ghana are forever linked by one of World Cup history's most controversial moments. In the 2010 quarter-final, Luis Suárez's deliberate handball on the line prevented a certain Ghana goal in extra time. Asamoah Gyan missed the resulting penalty, and Uruguay won the shootout, denying Africa a first-ever semi-finalist.\n\nThat match remains a source of immense pain for Ghanaian football. Gyan's miss and Suárez's celebration are seared into African football consciousness. This group stage rematch offers Ghana a chance at redemption 16 years later.\n\nUruguay enter without Suárez, who retired from international football, but the memory persists.",
