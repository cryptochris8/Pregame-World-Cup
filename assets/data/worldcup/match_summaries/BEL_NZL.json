  "historicalAnalysis": "New Zealand and Belgium have never met at a World Cup. Belgium's golden generation has produced consistent tournament performances without winning a major trophy. New Zealand remain unbeaten in World Cup history (3 draws in 2010).\n\nBelgium enter this tournament with their core aging but still formidable. De Bruyne and Lukaku lead a squad that has disappointed at the last two major tournaments.\n\nNew Zealand's World Cup history is brief but proud—their 2010 campaign saw them draw with Italy, Slovakia, and Paraguay without losing.",
