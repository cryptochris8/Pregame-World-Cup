  "historicalAnalysis": "Algeria and Austria have met at a World Cup before—at the 1982 World Cup in Spain. That encounter is best remembered for the infamous \"Disgrace of Gijón,\" where West Germany and Austria's later match appeared to produce a mutually beneficial result that eliminated Algeria despite their strong performances.\n\nAlgeria return to the World Cup after missing 2022, with revenge for historical injustice on many fans' minds. Their 2019 AFCON triumph showed their quality.\n\nAustria have improved dramatically under Rangnick's leadership. Their aggressive pressing and tactical sophistication make them dangerous opponents.",
