  "historicalAnalysis": "Scotland and Morocco have met only once before—a 1998 World Cup group match that ended 3-0 to Morocco. That result helped Morocco finish top of their group in one of their best World Cup performances.\n\nMorocco's 2022 World Cup semi-final run was historic—the first African and Arab nation to reach that stage. Their defensive organization and spirit captured hearts worldwide, and they enter 2026 as Africa's best hope.\n\nScotland return to the World Cup desperate to finally progress beyond the group stage. Their Premier League-laden squad has never been stronger.",
