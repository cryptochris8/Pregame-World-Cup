## r/worldcup — Best fit, most receptive

**Title:** I've been building a free World Cup 2026 app for the past year — looking for beta testers and feedback

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone,

I'm an indie developer and lifelong soccer fan, and I've been building a companion app
for the 2026 World Cup. It's been a solo project for about a year now and it's finally
at the point where I need real feedback from actual fans before the tournament starts.

Here's what it does:

- Full match schedule with all 104 matches across USA, Mexico & Canada
- All 48 teams with rosters, player stats, and manager profiles
- Group standings and interactive knockout bracket
- AI-powered match predictions and pre-match analysis
- Watch party creation — find or host watch parties in your city
- Venue discovery — find the best sports bars near each stadium
- Social features — add friends, chat, share predictions
- Push notifications for your favorite teams

It's free and currently available on iOS through TestFlight:
https://testflight.apple.com/join/fUcZMb3y

Android is in the works.

I'd really appreciate any feedback — what works, what doesn't, what features you'd
want to see added before June. I'm actively developing and can ship updates quickly.

Thanks for checking it out!

## r/soccer — Larger audience, stricter on self-promotion

**Title:** Built a free app for World Cup 2026 — looking for feedback from the community

**Body:**
```
Hey r/soccer,

I've spent the past year building a companion app for the 2026 World Cup as a side
project. With the tournament about 4 months away, I'm looking for feedback from
people who actually follow the sport.

Quick overview of what's in it:
- All 104 matches with schedules, venues, and group/knockout tracking
- 48 national team profiles with full squads and manager info
- AI match analysis and predictions for every game
- Watch party creation and venue discovery across all 16 host cities
- Social features to connect with other fans

It's free on iOS TestFlight: https://testflight.apple.com/join/fUcZMb3y
(Android coming soon)

I'm a solo dev so any honest feedback helps — happy to answer questions about the
tech or features. Would love to know what this community thinks is missing from
existing World Cup apps.

## r/MLS — US soccer community, good for venue/watch party angle

**Title:** I built a free World Cup 2026 app focused on the fan experience in host cities — need beta testers

**Body:**
```
Hey r/MLS,

With the World Cup coming to the US this summer, I've been building an app specifically
designed for fans watching from home, at sports bars, or traveling to host cities.

A few things that make it different from just checking ESPN scores:

- **Watch Parties** — create or join watch parties with other fans in your city
- **Venue Finder** — discover the best bars and restaurants near each of the 16 stadiums
- **AI Match Predictions** — pre-match analysis and insights for every game
- **Full Tournament Tracker** — schedules, groups, bracket, all 48 team rosters
- **Social/Messaging** — connect with friends, share predictions, chat during matches

I built this as a solo project and it's free. Currently in beta on iOS:

Android version is on the way.

Would love feedback from the US soccer community — especially around the watch party
and venue features since those are built for people watching stateside. What would
make this a must-have app for you this summer?
