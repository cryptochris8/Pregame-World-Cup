## Tips from Reddit's Best Practices

1. **Write like a Redditor** — conversational tone, no corporate speak
2. **Leave comments ON** — ads with comments look native and build trust
3. **Lead with value** — what does the user get, not what you're selling
4. **Test 3-5 creatives** — change one element at a time to find winners
5. **Use 4:5 portrait images** — 70%+ of Reddit users are on mobile
6. **Respond to ad comments** — engagement signals boost delivery
7. **Don't oversell** — Reddit users are skeptical of hype; be authentic
8. **Update countdown** — refresh the "X days until World Cup" number weekly
