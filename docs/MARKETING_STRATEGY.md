## Apple App Store Editorial Feature

> **This is a massive opportunity** given the World Cup timing. Apple features apps around major events like the Olympics and World Cup.

### Can You Submit While Still in TestFlight?

**YES!** You can (and should) submit for editorial featuring while your app is still in TestFlight. Here's why:

- The **"App Launch"** nomination type is specifically designed for apps that aren't live yet
- Apple **explicitly allows TestFlight links** as supplemental materials so their editorial team can review your app before launch
- The system is designed for **advance notice** - submit early so Apple can plan featuring around your launch
- This gives you an advantage over competitors who wait until their app is live

---

### Step-by-Step Submission Guide

#### Phase 1: Pre-Submission Preparation (1-2 Weeks Before Submitting)

2. **Align with Events**: Apple plans featuring around major events. The World Cup is perfect timing - emphasize this heavily.

3. **Tell a Story**: The "Helpful Details" field is your chance to connect emotionally. Share why you built this, your passion for the sport, your team's journey.

4. **Show, Don't Tell**: Your TestFlight link lets Apple experience your app firsthand. Make sure the build is polished and representative.

5. **Highlight Innovation**: Apple loves featuring apps that push boundaries. Your dual AI integration (Claude + OpenAI) is genuinely novel - lead with this.

6. **Accessibility Matters**: Apple deeply values accessibility. Document and emphasize your accessibility features.

7. **Quality Over Quantity**: One well-crafted nomination beats multiple rushed ones. Take time to perfect your submission.

8. **Keep Updating**: If your app evolves significantly in TestFlight, consider submitting an updated nomination with new details.

9. **Multiple Submissions**: You can submit again for "App Enhancement" after launch when you ship major updates.

10. **No Guarantees**: Apple doesn't feature every nominated app. Focus on making your nomination as compelling as possible, but have other marketing plans ready.

### Types of Agencies to Consider

| Agency Type | Best For | Budget Range |

| **Startup/Tech PR** | TechCrunch, Wired, The Verge coverage | $3K-10K/month |
| **Latino Market PR** | Telemundo, Univision, Spanish-language media | $3K-8K/month |
| **Boutique/Freelance** | Targeted campaigns, specific launches | $2K-5K/month |

### What to Look For

- **Relevant experience** - Have they launched sports or consumer apps?
- **Media relationships** - Do they have contacts at your target outlets?
- **Measurable results** - Can they show past coverage secured?
- **Cultural fit** - Do they understand your product and audience?

### DIY vs. Agency

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
